# PIC 16B Project Proposal

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You are required to include sections in your proposal that address the following topics. Feel free to include additional sections as needed. Remember that you can create Markdown sections using the # character.
>> **Meiyi Ye** - Role  
>>> I am majoring in Statistics and Data Science, this project is great for applying my knowledge from school to a practical, real world challenge. It involves data manipulation, application of statistical models, machine learning techniques, and possibly natural language processing for handling textual yelp review data. These are all key areas in the field of data science and directly relate to my coursework and training. I am interested in this project because this project allows me to leverage my skills in statistical analysis and machine learning in a context that impacts real businesses and consumers.
>>> 
>>
>> **Cynthia Du** - Role
>>> This project relates to my majors, Statistics + Data Science and Cognitive Science, because I hope to break into the data science industry and provide insights for businesses to implement more sustainable, equitable, and efficient business processes. This project will allow me to gain experience in creating a data science project, and familiarize myself with important data science concepts such as sentiment analysis and machine learning.
>>
>> **Nam Truong**
>>> I am a Mathematics of Computation major. For my career path I have taken an interest in software engineering and data science. I don’t have much exposure to data science so this project will allow me to gain experience. I am interested in this topic because I have always had interest in training some sort of machine learning model to predict some sort of data. More specifically, I live in an area that’s populated with businesses so if this project goes well and my interest takes me beyond this class I can use the end result or skill set from this project to potentially create a catering service for the businesses around me.


#### _Describe what problem the project addresses, the relation between your project and your background or major, and why you are interested in this project. ( 5 pts )_
> The project aims to predict business ratings based on Yelp data, which provides detailed information about the business. The prediction of business ratings is valuable for both customers and businesses because it allows consumers to make informed decisions on where to dine, and allows businesses to identify areas of improvement for customer satisfaction.
    
#### _Describe what resources, such as data, computing power, and etc, you need in order to complete your project. Please pay special attention to the question of data. If your project idea involves data, include at least one link to a data set you can use. It’s also acceptable to link to a website from which you intend to scrape the data you will use (although note that high-quality scraping is a lot of work).  ( 10 pts )_
> Insert text here.

#### _Summarize previous work related to your project. For example, if you want to do a data science project using dataset from Kaggle, you should summarize other's work (models, prediction error, and etc. ) ( 5 pts )_
> Insert text here.

#### _Describe required tools and skills. ( 10 pts )_
> We anticipate using Google Cloud to host our project. Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and Jupyter Notebook are some tools that we plan to use. Some skills we may be required to know to achieve our task of making accurate predictions of business ratings are: data preprocessing, data visualization, natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and various math/statistics concepts.

#### _Describe what you will learn.  ( 5 pts )_
> From our assignments and how our lecture notes are organized, everything is given to us in a step-by-step manner, walking us through how to work with some sort of data or code from scratch. This project will teach us how to set up our Python environment with the data so that we can apply the concepts that we have learned in class to preprocess the data to our needs and create a model to train our data on.

#### _Include group members and role and tentative timeline for each group member. ( 10 pts )_
> The names of the members that will be contributing to this project are:
>> **Meiyi Ye** - Role  
>>> Tentative timeline:
>>> - a
>>> - b
>>> - c
>>
>> **Cynthia Du** - Role
>>> Tentative timeline:
>>> - a
>>> - b
>>> - c
>>
>> **Nam Truong** - Role
>>> Tentative timeline:
>>> - a
>>> - b
>>> - c




#### _Other requirements: (5 pts)_
- [ ] There is <ins>no specifically required length</ins> for the proposal. Generally speaking, I would expect a thoughtful proposal to require around 600-900 words.
- [ ] The proposal is written in clear English prose.
- [ ] The proposal is hosted on GitHub as the top-level README.md file in a repository.
- [ ] You should submit a pdf file to Gradescope. All other formats are not accepted.
Grading is based on required sections and other requirements.
