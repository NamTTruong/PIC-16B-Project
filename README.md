There is no specifically required length for the proposal. Generally speaking, I would expect a thoughtful proposal to require around 600-900 words.
The proposal is written in clear English prose.
The proposal is hosted on GitHub as the top-level README.md file in a repository.
You should submit a pdf file to Gradescope. All other formats are not accepted.
Grading is based on required sections and other requirements.
